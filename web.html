                Web design is the process of creating websites. It encompasses
                several different aspects, including webpage layout, content
                production, and graphic design. While the terms web design and
                web development are often used interchangeably, web design is
                technically a subset of the broader category of web development.
              </p>
              <p class="para">
                Websites are created using a markup language called HTML. Web
                designers build webpages using HTML tags that define the content
                and metadata of each page. The layout and appearance of the
                elements within a webpage are typically defined using CSS, or
                cascading style sheets. Therefore, most websites include a
                combination of HTML and CSS that defines how each page will
                appear in a browser.
              </p>
              <p class="para">
                While HTML and CSS are used to design the look and feel of a
                website, images must be created separately. Therefore, graphic
                design may overlap with web design, since graphic designers
                often create images for use on the Web. Some graphics programs
                like Adobe Photoshop even include a "Save for Web…" option that
                provides an easy way to export images in a format optimized for
                web publishing.

                A Web developer is a kind of programmer who specializes in the
                development of applications relating to the World Wide Web or
                distributed network applications, which typically run protocols
                like HTTP from a Web server to a client browser using associated
                programming languages like HTML/CSS, C#, Ruby and PHP to name a
                few.
              </p>
              <p class="para">
                A Web developer is usually concerned with the back end or the
                programming aspect of creating a website or Web application and
                is not to be confused with a Web designer, who only deals with
                the aesthetics of a website or application, although many
                professionals have both skill sets.
              </p>
              <p class="para">
                Notice, that web developers are further split into two
                sub-categories; front-end developers, and back-end developers. I
                see front-end developers as the connection between both web
                designers and back-end developers, as having a little knowledge
                of both, would allow a front-end developer to build a fully
                working website. A front-end developer is the one who builds the
                interface, and provides the layout as the interaction between
                the back-end of the website and the user.
